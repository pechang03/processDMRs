def analyze_triconnected_components(graph: nx.Graph) -> Tuple[List[Set], Dict]:
    """
    Find and analyze triconnected components of a graph.
    
    A triconnected component is a maximal subgraph that remains connected after removing
    any two vertices. The analysis categorizes these components based on their structure
    and composition in the bipartite graph context.
    
    Implementation Notes:
    -------------------
    Future implementation will:
    1. Find separation pairs (vertex pairs whose removal disconnects graph)
       - Use depth-first search to find articulation pairs
       - Track parent/child relationships in DFS tree
       - Identify back edges and cross edges
    
    2. Split graph at separation pairs
       - Create new vertices for each side of split
       - Maintain mapping of original vertices
       - Handle multiple splits at same vertex
    
    3. Identify triconnected components
       - Components that cannot be split further
       - Special cases: bonds (3-edge components)
       - Handle polygons vs. general components
    
    4. Calculate statistics for each component:
       total: Total number of triconnected components found
       single_node: Components reduced to single vertices after splits
       small: Components with either:
           - Only 2 vertices total
           - Only 1 DMR node
           - Only 1 gene node
       interesting: Components with:
           - More than 2 vertices AND
           - At least 2 DMR nodes AND
           - At least 2 gene nodes
       avg_dmrs: Mean number of DMR nodes in interesting components
       avg_genes: Mean number of gene nodes in interesting components

                "single_node": int, # Single vertex components
                "small": int,       # 2-vertex or 1 DMR/gene components

    1. Add separation pair identification
    2. Implement SPQR tree construction
    3. Add component classification
    4. Add bipartite-specific analysis
    5. Add visualization support
    6. Add detailed component reporting
