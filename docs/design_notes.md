I'm not opposed to using react. I need it to be as easy to interface with mcp and be standard code I also need to draw networks. Either with plotify or something else. So do you suggest keeping my current code with Flask and adding nodejs support, moving to React, or some hiebrid of React, Flask and nodejs? The main issue wit hthe LLMs seem very bad at the sort of dynamic HTML Flask uses
Given your requirements for network visualization and the challenges with LLMs handling dynamic Flask HTML, I would recommend a hybrid approach with these components:

1. Flask (Backend):

   - Keep your existing Flask backend for data processing and database operations
   - Convert it to serve as a REST API
   - Handle authentication and session management

2. React (Frontend):

   - Use it for the main user interface
   - Better ecosystem for network visualizations with libraries like:
     - react-force-graph (3D network visualizations)
     - react-vis-network (2D network graphs)
     - plotly-react (interactive scientific charts)
   - More structured and maintainable frontend code
   - Better developer tools and debugging
   - Easier for LLMs to maintain and modify

3. Node.js/Express:
   - Handle WebSocket connections for MCP
   - Serve the React application
   - Manage real-time communications

This architecture would give you:

1. Clean separation of concerns
2. Better maintainability
3. Rich ecosystem for network visualizations
4. Easier LLM integration for future development
5. Standard patterns that LLMs understand well

The migration could be done in phases:

1. First, keep Flask serving pages but start building new features in React
2. Gradually move existing Flask templates to React components
3. Convert Flask routes to API endpoints
4. Add Node.js/Express for MCP integration

Would you like to proceed with this hybrid approach? We can start by setting up the initial React application alongside your existing Flask code, and then gradually migrate features.

Note: This approach would require more initial setup but will be more maintainable and scalable in the long run, especially when working with LLMs.
