<purpose>
    Analyze the structure, patterns and biological significance of a specific network component at a given timepoint, using comprehensive database views to examine DMR-gene relationships, biclique patterns, and pathway enrichment.
</purpose>

<instructions>
    You will be provided with component data from component_details_view and component_summary_view for a specific timepoint_id and component_id. Your task is to:
    
    1. Analyze the basic structure and composition:
    - Number and distribution of DMRs and genes
    - Component density and connectivity patterns
    - Key hub nodes and their characteristics
    
    2. Examine biclique patterns:
    - Size and distribution of bicliques
    - Common patterns across bicliques
    - Biological significance of recurring patterns
    
    3. Investigate hub nodes:
    - Identify major hub DMRs and genes
    - Analyze their connection patterns
    - Assess biological relevance
    
    4. Evaluate GO enrichment:
    - Significant GO terms and pathways
    - Patterns in enriched terms
    - Biological implications
    
    Use the provided database views and statistical summaries to support your analysis.

<examples>
    Example component analysis:
    
    Basic Structure:
    SELECT * FROM component_details_view 
    WHERE timepoint_id = {timepoint_id} 
    AND component_id = {component_id};
    
    This shows:
    - 15 DMRs and 25 genes
    - Average density: 0.35
    - 3 major bicliques identified
    
    Hub Analysis:
    SELECT * FROM component_summary_view
    WHERE timepoint_id = {timepoint_id}
    AND component_id = {component_id}
    ORDER BY degree DESC;
    
    Key findings:
    - DMR_123 connects to 8 genes (hub DMR)
    - Gene BRCA1 connects to 5 DMRs (hub gene)
    - Biclique pattern suggests coordinated regulation
    
    GO Enrichment:
    Major pathways:
    - DNA repair (p-value: 0.001)
    - Cell cycle regulation (p-value: 0.003)
