    # DMR Area vs Biclique Participation Analysis

    ## Primary Query
    ```sql
    -- Get DMR area stats grouped by biclique participation
    SELECT 
        CASE 
            WHEN biclique_ids IS NULL THEN 'No bicliques'
            WHEN array_length(string_to_array(biclique_ids, ','), 1) = 1 THEN 'Single biclique'
            ELSE 'Multiple bicliques'
        END as participation_type,
        COUNT(*) as dmr_count,
        AVG(area_stat) as avg_area,
        STDDEV(area_stat) as area_stddev
    FROM dmr_annotations_view
    GROUP BY participation_type
    ORDER BY avg_area DESC;
    ```

    ## Biological Significance
    This analysis helps understand if DMRs with larger affected areas tend to participate 
    in more bicliques, which could indicate their role as regulatory hubs.

    ## Visualization Suggestions
    - Box plot of area statistics by participation type
    - Scatter plot of area vs number of bicliques
    
    ## Follow-up Analyses
    1. Examine correlation with gene expression data
    2. Look for timepoint-specific patterns
    3. Analyze chromosome distribution of high-area DMRs
