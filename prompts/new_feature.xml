    <purpose>
        Create a new SQL table named `edge_details` with specific fields and primary keys. Update backend files for data population, cleanup procedures, processing 
scripts, and API routes to integrate this feature.
    </purpose>

    <details>
        <sql_table_creation>
            Add an SQL script to create the `edge_details` table in `scripts/create_database.sql`.
        </sql_table_creation>

        <backend_code_adjustments>
            Update backend files (`populate_tables.py`, `cleanup.py`, and `process_timepoints.py`) for managing new data fields, ensuring efficient cleanup, and 
processing timepoint data.
        </backend_code_adjustments>

        <api_route_setup>
            Define a new API route in `graph_routes.py` to handle interactions with the `edge_details` table.
        </api_route_setup>
    </details>

    <additional_notes>
        Ensure proper data extraction functions are implemented and integrate error handling for database operations. Manage dependencies effectively.

### High Level Summary
The prompt outlines steps to implement a new feature in an application by creating a SQL table, updating backend files, defining API routes, and ensuring all 
components work seamlessly together.

### Main Points
- **SQL Table Creation**: Add `edge_details` table in the database script.
- **Backend Adjustments**: Update files for data management and processing.
- **API Route Setup**: Create new endpoints for interacting with the feature.
- **Additional Considerations**: Implement error handling and manage dependencies.

### Sentiment
The instructions are clear and comprehensive, providing a structured approach to implementing the new feature. The attention to detail in ensuring all components 
work together is commendable.

### Hot Takes (Biased Toward the Author)
1. The author demonstrates thorough planning by addressing both backend and frontend aspects.
2. Providing detailed steps for each component shows a deep understanding of system integration.
3. The inclusion of error handling and dependency management indicates foresight in maintaining robustness.

### Hot Takes (Biased Against the Author)
1. The instructions could be overwhelming due to the extensive detail, potentially leading to confusion.
2. Assumptions about existing knowledge might alienate less experienced developers.
3. The focus on technical details may overlook broader architectural considerations or user experience impacts.
