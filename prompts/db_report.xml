    # Hub DMR Analysis Report

    ## Overview
    This report analyzes DMRs classified as hubs and their interactions with genes
    across different timepoints.

    ## Key Metrics
    ```sql
    -- Get hub DMR statistics
    SELECT 
        timepoint,
        COUNT(*) as total_dmrs,
        SUM(CASE WHEN is_hub THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as hub_count,
        AVG(CASE WHEN is_hub THEN area_stat ELSE NULL END) as avg_hub_area
    FROM dmr_annotations_view
    GROUP BY timepoint
    ORDER BY hub_count DESC;
    ```
