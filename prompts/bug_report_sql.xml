    <description>
        An error occurred while generating graph visualizations due to the absence of the column 'area_stat' in the view 'dmr_annotations_view'. This resulted in a 
failure when attempting to execute a query expecting this column.

    <root_cause_analysis>
        The 'area_stat' column is present in the 'dmr' table but not included in the 'dmr_annotations_view'. This oversight causes an operational error when 
executing queries that reference this missing column.
    </root_cause_analysis>

    <solution_proposal>
        <step>
            <description>Modify the SQL view definition to include the 'area_stat' column.</description>
            <action>
                Edit the file `backend/app/database/management/sql/views/create_views.sql` to update the creation script for `dmr_annotations_view`, ensuring that it 
selects the 'area_stat' from the appropriate base table.
            </action>
        </step>

        <step>
            <description>Update the corresponding schema definition in Python.</description>
            <action>
                Adjust the field definitions within `backend/app/schemas.py` to reflect the inclusion of 'area_stat' as part of the expected fields for visualization 
purposes.
            </action>
        </step>

        <step>
            <description>Test and validate changes.</description>
            <action>
                Execute comprehensive tests on graph generation routes to confirm that the error is resolved and no new issues are introduced. Ensure all queries 
involving 'dmr_annotations_view' work as expected with the updated schema.
