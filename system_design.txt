Pairwise Comparison Analysis
---------------------------
1. **Multiple Dataset Handling**
   - Processes both overall (DSS1.xlsx) and pairwise comparison (DSS_PAIRWISE.xlsx) data
   - Creates separate bipartite graphs for overall and each pairwise comparison
   - Maintains consistent gene ID mapping across all analyses
   - Enables comparative analysis between different conditions

2. **Pairwise Processing**
   - Processes overall dataset for complete picture
   - Dynamically reads pairwise comparison sheets from DSS_PAIRWISE.xlsx
   - Each pairwise comparison processed independently
   - Separate biclique analysis for overall and each comparison

3. **Output Organization**
   - Separate graph files for overall and each pairwise comparison
   - Consistent naming convention using comparison sheet names
   - Maintains traceability between source sheets and output files
   - Enables parallel processing of comparisons

DMR Analysis System Design
=========================

Core Architecture
----------------
- **Modular design** with clear separation between data processing, analysis, and visualization.
  - Benefits: Easier maintenance, scalability, and reusability of components.
- Uses **NetworkX** for graph operations, **Plotly** for interactive visualizations, and **Pandas** for data processing.
- **Flask-based web interface** for result display.
- **Layout System**: Implements polymorphic layout strategies through BaseLayout abstract class
  - Supports multiple visualization approaches (spring, circular)
  - Enables easy addition of new layout algorithms
  - Provides consistent interface for all layout implementations

Key Components
-------------
1. **Data Processing**
   - Handles Excel input files containing DMR and gene data using **Pandas**.
   - Creates bipartite graph structure (DMRs to genes).
   - Manages gene ID mapping system.

2. **Biclique Analysis**
   - Identifies complete bipartite subgraphs.
   - Classifies bicliques (trivial, small, interesting).
   - Tracks edge classifications and sources.

3. **Visualization System**
   - Hierarchical visualization components:
     * Core plotting (create_biclique_visualization)
     * Trace creation (nodes, edges, biclique boxes)
     * Polymorphic layout system:
       - BaseLayout abstract class
       - OriginalGraphLayout for spring embedding
       - CircularBicliqueLayout for biclique visualization
       - SpringLogicalLayout for logical constraints
   - Uses EdgeInfo objects to track edge metadata
   - Supports multiple input formats for flexibility

4. **Dominating Set Analysis**
   - RB-Domination: Implements red-blue domination algorithm for bipartite graphs
   - Greedy Approach: Uses heap-based greedy selection with utility scoring
   - Minimization: Includes post-processing to remove redundant dominators
   - Statistics: Tracks coverage metrics and component-level domination

Data Structures
--------------
1. **EdgeInfo**
   - Encapsulates edge data and metadata.
   - Tracks edge sources and classifications.
   - Supports JSON serialization.

2. **NodeInfo**
   - Manages node categorization (DMR vs gene).
   - Tracks split genes and node degrees.
   - Provides type checking methods.

Design Decisions
---------------
1. **Edge Classification**
   - Uses dictionary-based classification system.
   - Categories: permanent, false_positive, false_negative.
   - Supports both EdgeInfo objects and raw tuples for backward compatibility.

2. **Layout Strategy System**
   - Abstract BaseLayout class provides interface for layout algorithms
   - Enables polymorphic layout selection at runtime
   - Separates layout logic from visualization logic
   - Makes adding new layout algorithms straightforward
   - Key implementations:
     * Original graph layout (spring embedding)
     * Circular biclique layout
     * Spring layout with logical constraints

3. **Component Organization**
   - Separate modules for different visualization aspects.
   - Clear hierarchy of functionality.
   - Modular trace creation for maintainability.

4. **Dominating Set Implementation**
   - Chose greedy approach for balance of efficiency and solution quality
   - Component Integration: Integrated with component analysis for granular insights
   - Caching Strategy: Cached dominating set results with component statistics

Future Considerations
-------------------
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - May need caching for large graphs.
   - Consider batch processing for edge traces.

2. **Extensibility**
   - Design supports adding new edge/node types.
   - Visualization system can be extended for new features.

3. **Data Validation**
   - Currently implements basic validation.
   - May need more robust error checking.

4. **Layout Extensions**
   - Additional layout algorithms can be added by implementing BaseLayout
   - Potential for hybrid layouts combining multiple strategies
   - Could add interactive layout adjustment capabilities
   - Support for custom layout constraints and parameters
