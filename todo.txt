                                      Actionable Steps

                           1. Investigate Biclique Mining Process

 • Check the Biclique File Contents:
    • Ensure that the bipartite_graph_output.txt.biclusters file generated by the external
      biclique mining tool is correctly formatted and contains the expected data.
 • Adjust Algorithm Parameters:
    • Experiment with different parameters for the biclique mining tool to increase edge
      coverage.
 • Run Biclique Mining Locally (if applicable):
    • If the biclique mining tool is run externally, consider running it locally to have
      better control over the parameters and process.

                               2. Enhance Biclique Validation

 • Modify the read_bicliques_file function to include more thorough validation of the
   bicliques against the original graph.
 • Implement logging or debugging statements to trace how bicliques are being parsed and
   added.

                                   3. Visualize Bicliques

 • Since you have a visualization component, try generating visual representations of the
   bicliques to better understand their structure.
 • Focus on the interesting bicliques (those with ≥3 DMRs and ≥3 genes) to see if they make
   sense in the context of your data.

                          4. Reassess Red-Blue Domination Algorithm

 • Review Degree-1 Gene Processing:
    • Confirm that the processing of degree-1 genes is correctly implemented and doesn't
      inadvertently exclude potential dominating DMRs.
 • Examine Dominated Genes:
    • Check if all genes are indeed dominated and whether any DMRs could be removed without
      loss of coverage.

                            5. Update Data and Metadata Handling

 • Gene Annotations:
    • The gene descriptions are showing as N/A for many genes, indicating missing metadata.
    • Ensure that the gene ID mappings and descriptions are correctly loaded and associated.

                                           Summary

 • Successful Execution: The script runs without errors, and the immediate issue with
   zero-degree nodes has been resolved.
 • Low Biclique Edge Coverage: A significant number of edges are not covered by any
   bicliques, suggesting a need to revisit the biclique mining approach.
 • Dominating Set Coverage: All genes are covered, but no redundant DMRs were found, which
   might warrant further examination of the minimization logic.

                                      Final Suggestions

 • Collaborate with Team Members:
    • Discuss these findings with your team to get additional perspectives, especially if
      others are familiar with the biclique mining tool.
 • Iterative Testing:
    • Make incremental changes to the parameters and re-run the script to observe how the
      outputs change.
 • Documentation:
    • Keep detailed notes of any changes made and the corresponding outputs to track progress
      effectively.

Let me know if you'd like assistance with adjusting specific parts of the code or
interpreting other sections of the output!

The key changes are:

 1 Removed the incorrect overlap handling between DMR and gene sets
 2 Simplified node type determination based on bipartite graph
   properties
 3 Maintained proper handling of split genes (genes appearing in
   multiple bicliques)
 4 Kept the clear separation between DMR nodes (x=0) and gene nodes
   (x=1 for regular, x=1.1 for split)

This version better reflects the bipartite nature of the graph while
still properly handling split genes.
